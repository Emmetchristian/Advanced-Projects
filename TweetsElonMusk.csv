FSD Beta has now been expanded to ~2000 owners we‚Äôve also revoked beta where drivers did not pay sufficient attention to the road. No accidents to date. Next significant release will be in April. Going with pure vision ‚Äî not even using radar. This is the way to real-world AI.

 SpaceX will do ~75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon. A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year.  Even so ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars.

 it flies back to land which costs much less than using a droneship. Our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. Last year SpaceX launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world.
 but at least not absurd.
 glass coming soon.
 we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity but would work. But optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass so it‚Äôs not a gamechanger.
 same as booster

 but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level.  Something similar happened on an early Falcon 1 flight resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff.

 CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid.  Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time.

 whether or not ordered as an option.
Availability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays and/or Tesla internal development testing.  Note: word ‚ÄúBeta‚Äù is used to reduce complacency in usage set expectations appropriately. All software is first tested internally by Tesla simulation QA drive teams.

 as ~5X more efficient than nitrogen (300 sec vs 60 sec Isp)

 it would seem so but turbopump-fed Raptors have much higher thrust propellant mass fraction than pressure-fed gas thrusters they‚Äôre already there


 engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are good.
 but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk so landing on 3 engines means high thrust/weight (further away from hover point) which is also risky

 but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage.

 but not later versions of Merlin or Starship/Raptor
 so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant the primary cost. For expendable rockets throwing away stages is the primary cost so optimization is low T/W.

 but it‚Äôs essential to view this as output vs time. As with all manufacturing especially new technology output will follow an S-curve. Very slow at first but increasing exponentially then linear then logarithmic.


 4680 (world‚Äôs most advanced cells made on-site) both front rear body castings advanced paint shop. Warning: with so much new technology production timing is naturally harder to predict.
 Human Revolution was also great


Ascent to the Heavens 

 briefly. Seems pretty good. I picked Nomad so start was a little slow but picks up fast. Seemed like almost everyone on Steam was playing Cyberpunk at some point this weekend!

Hehe 




 it would use more mass than a tile heatshield but that remains to be seen.
 windward will have black hexagonal heat shield tiles

 should be preserved in memory of SN8

 so controlling all way to putting the crater in the right spot was epic!!
Thank you South Texas for your support! This is the gateway to Mars.
Life the Universe and Everything 
 engines did great!
Mars here we come!!
Fuel header tank pressure was low during landing burn causing touchdown velocity to be high RUD but we got all the data we needed! Congrats SpaceX team hell yeah!!
Successful ascent switchover to header tanks precise flap control to landing point!

Much of what people think of an science is actually engineering eg no such thing as a ‚Äúrocket scientist‚Äù only rocket engineers. Latter is who put humans on the moon.
Science is discovering the essential truths about what exists in the Universe engineering is about creating things that never existed 





 which adds mass. Wider stance adds mass. Shock absorbers add mass. That said we need better legs.
 but we need to clear the build site for early flights


 very sad news. Tony was great.
 I thought that was a pic of Thanos haha

Happy Thanksgiving!

 so acts automatically.


 as we did for the original

.

This is a life leader launch so more risk than normal
 but only slightly filled


 but overall similar. Wiring is more robust engines are more mature nosecone is sealed better etc.

 so maybe 1/3 chance
Good Starship SN8 static fire! Aiming for first 15km / ~50k ft altitude flight next week. Goals are to test 3 engine ascent body flaps transition from main to header tanks landing flip.


 but it‚Äôs probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull.
 low cost propellant orbital refilling propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary

Tomorrow will be the 7th flight of this rocket landing on droneship Of Course I Still Love You



 but hates hypocrisy




Landing at Vandenberg AFB in California
 off to the side (so it doesn‚Äôt take out the launch mount in bad landing) but with the same arm used to pick up the ship

 but investing is not what I do. But I always put my own money into companies I help create otherwise it‚Äôd be wrong to ask others to do so.
Well almost anything
Quite the day ahead


 but it feels like nothing





 use an occlusion penetrating wavelength like precision radar at ~4mm.


 but you‚Äôre roughly in the ballpark. Wow rocket turbopumps especially if oxygen-rich are insanely hard! Arguably the hardest mechanical/fluids/combustion problem known to exist.
 this was just an XPeng problem. Other companies in China have not done this.
 but it should be said that we have a very talented Autopilot/AI team at Tesla. Too much credit comes to me Andrej.






 otherwise fine



 we will widen beta
 there are too many rules around liquor distribution even in the US. However we will be selling the lightning bottle shot glasses worldwide.
 both important bug fixes entire new areas of functionality.





 we can establish a human base there in our lifetime. At least a future spacefaring civilization ‚Äì discovering our ruins ‚Äì will be impressed humans got that far.



 nor do these indices. Buy hold stock in companies where you love the product roadmap sell where you don‚Äôt. 
 just a mild cold. Same with my bro. Def had cov2 though. Pc&lt;20 means viral load of &gt;10 million per mL.
 terraformed to support life like Earth.

 but that seemed too obvious haha

 while getting another test. Second test determines whether they‚Äôre just beginning to get ill or are on the long tail afterwards where viral fragments exist but person is not infectious.


Tesla holiday software release is üî•üî•

 otherwise extreme overkill for mere Earth sector activity!  Starship fleet mass to orbit per year will be more than 1000 times all current Earth rockets combined including Falcon. Necessary for a city on Mars.

Nullius in Verba 


 looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than $1M for more than 100 tons to orbit so it‚Äôs mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year

 but kerosene is suboptimal fuel no matter what you do.  What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene so ~78% of propellant is oxygen.
 but from a visiting American. Ah the irony is just too much!!
 PCR Ct was unequivocal at &lt;20. Doesn‚Äôt matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold.

 this was one of the mildest cold/flu experiences I‚Äôve ever had.

 martyte covering concrete below shattered sending blades of hardened rock into engine bay. One rock blade severed avionics cable causing bad shutdown of Raptor.


 production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important but it‚Äôs less than 1% of the pain.


 more Teslaquila next month.




 that‚Äôs not easy! I spent quite a bit of time looking at Russian/Ukrainian engines. They‚Äôre good.



 Moderna a few others. Tesla makes the machine CureVac uses to go from known gene sequence to trillions of lipid-coated mRNA strands.



 thanks for asking. No symptoms for past few days apart from fatigue. Unless something changes would have to say that it simply felt like a mild cold.
‚ô•Ô∏è
Launch in 5 minutes
 with cooling channels integrated into the chamber walls
The same propellant is used either for abort or for orbital maneuvering as one use obviates the other
Dragon can also hover land propulsively but we use the parachutes for maximum safety 
Thrusters are integrated with spacecraft enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety

 I feel pretty normal. No symptoms right now. Last week I had symptoms of a minor cold. I‚Äôve had some brutal flu/cold experiences but this was mild hopefully over.
 same time of day administered by RN am requesting N1 gene PCR cycle threshold. There is no official standard for PCR testing. Not sure people realize this.
 too bad they had this pointless argument
Astronaut launch today!



Worth reading this thread if you‚Äôre curious about rona testing
 they tell you the number not just if it‚Äôs high/not-high. There is not a clear consensus on what Ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes ‚Äúpositive‚Äù.
 but more body achy cloudy head than coughing/sneezing. DayQuil rocks.
 at what Ct number for the cov2 N1 gene should a PCR test probably be regarded as positive? If I‚Äôm asking the wrong question what is a better question?

 but please be super cautious. Expect two steps forward one back. Lot of new code was merged.

 but most likely I have a moderate case of covid. My symptoms are that of a minor cold which is no surprise since a coronavirus is a type of cold.


Unless you‚Äôre on DMT
Laws of thermodynamics: 1. You can‚Äôt win 2. You can‚Äôt break even 3. You can‚Äôt stop playing
Shakes fist at entropy

 so hopefully better results.






 you‚Äôre probably not infectious above 30 you probably are below 25. Sound about right?

Case closed 
Soon 
 lab I just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate 30 to 40 gets dicey above 40 is bs. Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere.
Lab I just spoke to said cov2 PCR detection (N1 N3 genes) below 30 cycles is reliable above 40 cycles is not
 this is not the spike protein. They don‚Äôt consider that reliable.
 unique to cov2. N3 is also sought but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles 40 cycles is their max.

 they will assume they have it when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu.
 lower the true prevalence the higher the false positive number will be. This sounds obvious but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low.


Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. What‚Äôs the approximate false positive rate all things considered for cov2 PCR tests?


What is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles?
 although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. Hard to get a straight answer.  False positives will roughly scale with # of tests daily test rate has gone ballistic: 
 no symptoms although I did take NyQuil.
 I tested positive then negative twice then positive again so ‚ÄúElon Musk Tests Negative for Covid‚Äù is an equally correct title. The ‚Äúrapid antigen test‚Äù from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin.
The carousel turns ever faster



 it‚Äôs happening to others. I‚Äôm getting PCR tests from separate labs. Results will take about 24 hours.
Something extremely bogus is going on. Was tested for covid four times today. Two tests came back negative two came back positive. Same machine same test same nurse. Rapid antigen test from BD.
 so vehicle appears to be ok. We‚Äôll have to swap out at least one of the engines.

 otherwise it‚Äôs going to pop the cork.

 it will transfer processing to the supercomputer extension of your brain. This is basically what you do when you use a smartphone or computer but a Neuralink will have orders of magnitude faster input output especially latter.
 but benchmark we‚Äôre tracking is frames/second. Must beat next gen GPU/TPU clusters or it‚Äôs pointless.




 especially in large intersections with dense vehicle pedestrian traffic. Frame rate latency from frame to wheel vector change also important.

When sending your resume please describe a few of the hardest problems you solved exactly how you solved them
A New Banner is needed Neither hard left nor right

 Tesla the (commutator-free three-phase) AC induction motor in other words a useful electric motor
 Inc. was almost called Faraday as it took until late 2004/2005 to buy the trademark from a guy who had had it since 1995.
420 is ten times better than 42
ü§ó

Recruiting ace engineers for Giga Berlin! Will interview in person tomorrow on site. Send resume to 25Guns


 but did not succeed at engineering (and he tried)
 that will be relatively easy as so few users out in the ocean
 although I didn‚Äôt expect the stock to rise so much so soon. The reason for the stock options is that they‚Äôre needed to help pay for humanity to get to Mars in 10 to 20 years.
 Steve! That convertible loan gave us 6 months of runway. Fortunately Daimler invested $50M in May 2009 5 months later.

 even though I thought we would still fail. But it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then) while stalwarts like GM Chrysler were going bankrupt.
 as investors were leaving town that night we were 3 days away from bankruptcy. I put in all money I had didn‚Äôt own a house had to borrow money from friends to pay rent. Difficult time.

 which may sound rather pedestrian is actually our most difficult technical challenge
 around middle of next year.
 it takes about 5 mins to set up but with future improvements probably less than 3 mins. No technical knowledge needed. Just point at open sky plug in!


 as no EU-wide approval system exists. Probably start receiving final (there are many steps) approvals around Feb/March.
 so probably January
Several thousand more Starlink beta participation invitations going out this week


Very close to actual expected flight!
 while it is considerably larger I don‚Äôt think it necessarily requires all that much incremental engineering.
 maybe in a month or so
 it‚Äôs basically a tank from the future that‚Äôs road-legal so yeah


Penguin Random House üò¥ should change the name to Random Penguinüî•
 although it might be quite a short livestream! Lot can go wrong but we‚Äôll provide video warts all. You will see every frame that we do.

 so it will probably work at scale but reality tends to bite you on the ass


 if it fails right at the end some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the crater.

 yaw roll during descent such that the ship is positioned well to relight flip land would be a big win
 a RUD right off launch pad is also possible. Fortunately SN9 is almost ready.
 controlled descent with body flaps would be great. Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks relight would be a major win.

 but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human
 resulting in perhaps ~1/3 fewer interventions. Many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments. True for most beta releases in my experience.




 frankly I think CA has the winning-for-too-long problem.  Like a sports team with many championships it is increasingly difficult to avoid complacency a sense of entitlement.

 fewer heart attacks as way easier to pump blood in 37% gravity.

 literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades.  Most of the factory had no equipment at all! Even light bulbs were missing in some areas. GM Toyota took everything that worked moved it to their other factories.
 fixed the trusty old bots brought the factory back to life.




 tbh our capex efficiency in 2017 was trash üò¨

 very helpful. Thanks all beta testers!

 this time electric

Congratulations SpaceX Team!

 it could be an option in settings


 so maybe we could talk then. Given that Starship is not exactly subtle this is more of a design clarification to match what people can already see.


 there‚Äôll be a lot of 2 steps fwd 1 step back situations but pace of improvement will be extremely fast.


Price change is pushed to Thursday next week. Applies only to US for now. One week clock will start in other countries as beta is released. FSD monthly rental will also be available sometime next year.

 we have said many times that the price will rise as the product functionality improves. How much time do you think we should give?

 but standing down to re-examine whole vehicle just in case.

Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday
 rules languages around world not to mention driving on left side of road! Also a long challenging road lies ahead getting to high 9‚Äôs reliability (way beyond human).



 a single state. Tesla will do lithium mining only as needed. We also found a way to extract lithium using NaCl (table salt).

 ya gotta have a tiki bar 
Starship nosecone high bay tiki bar 



 but would be dicey. Pushing it for near-term tests doesn‚Äôt achieve anything but I‚Äôm confident Raptor will do 300 bar for orbital flights.

FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow cautious as it should.
Data from 3 engine Starship static fire this morning looks good. Proceeding with nosecone mate.



 but yes
 fusion has too little. We need Mobi-D haha.

 but he‚Äôs in a tough position with so many constituencies to please. No way to make everyone happy.
 but ~99% is civilian.
 we got stuck in a lot of local maximums which wasn‚Äôt clear until we hit the ceiling. This time it‚Äôs right.
 much more accurate haha

 which are &lt;10% of production costs are primarily manual.

 as promised. This will at first be limited to a small number of people who are expert careful drivers.
 exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony like a symphony so it‚Äôs fairly obvious when one is discordant
 so we do get full use of 144 TOPS but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails.
 which are certainly good companies could meet any of our capability schedule cost or power requirements.



 here we go 

 there are literally &gt;1000% more cameras than 10 years ago but still zero clear photos
 it‚Äôs still a big deal!


 we would place a large order! Unfortunately great engineers are very rare. This is solved in the FSD build.

 but was rich all along invented nothing (as far as I know). I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009 had no house had to borrow money from friends to pay rent.
 no choice but to be CEO.
 no one left with him. That says it all.




 failure to protect nursing homes was a major mistake (happened in most countries). Herd immunity for vast majority of people quarantine vulnerable was right though imo.

 but they‚Äôre on the inside. Also a good telephoto lens will be able to capture what I‚Äôve posted. And yeah anyone who can reverse engineer what I‚Äôve posted doesn‚Äôt need to reverse engineer!




 pointer (or other memory) problems can be detected at compile time or disambiguated by asking the user.




 it‚Äôs not a contest. Advanced casting crushes best-case 3D printing but casting doesn‚Äôt work well for complex enclosed volumes high strength or high temp alloys.


 but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation.  It‚Äôs already sensible for rocket engine parts. To the best of our knowledge SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive.
 but I think it may end on a high note



 we will play sexy snake jazz ü§£

 provided we do our metal gear snake autocoupler
 but a highly specialized solution. The Tesla approach is a general solution. The latest build is capable of zero intervention drives. Will release limited beta in a few weeks.
 we could put in a setting allowing it to drop as low as 5%
 there will need to be an arm that lifts booster to launch stand ship to booster.



 but this could turn out to be a mistake

 but will let you know when there is another one

 even when the latter is cooled to just above its freezing point.







 but none of those companies have made one.
 the Gigafactory is the hardest most critical product
 eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough.


 but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three.
 but it‚Äôs fun takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10000 people hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly.

 but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can‚Äôt emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part.

 a new paint system.  Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin which means significant production risk. Fremont Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven.


 which is fine for flight. This was a proof test rather than a burst test. We‚Äôll hopefully fix the leak today retest.
 but a small leak opened up near the engine mounts possibly due to differential shrinking




 we will be able to roll out a fairly wide public beta in northern US hopefully southern Canada. Other countries to follow as soon as we receive regulatory approval.


 yes it was the 3rd flight of this booster 3rd flight for active half of fairing. Aiming for 10+ flights of booster fairing by end of next year.
4th flight landing for this booster
5 minutes from launch. Looks good so far.
 especially in dense cities with heavy traffic where your air intake is jammed up against another car‚Äôs exhaust pipe.
 but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026. Larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale. Goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market.
Turn volume to 11 play Powerglide in your Tesla  

Music volume on a Tesla goes to 11 because it‚Äôs louder than 10

Call of Booty great game


 propulsion structures avionics range regulatory constraints this weekend. I will also be at the Cape next week to review hardware in person.







 Starship update coming in about 3 weeks. The design has coalesced. What is presented will actually be what flies to orbit as V1.0 with almost no changes.


 so probably 3 months or so for good connectivity ‚Äî needs several more Starlink launches. I‚Äôm using it at the little house I rent in the area. Definitely not good there yet.
 legacy Internet latency will be zero.

 Starlink is designed to enable competitive gaming
 although filling up the ship in orbit isn‚Äôt required for Mars so 4 is possible
 especially for remote regions or for emergency services when landlines are damaged

 as we‚Äôre actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine scientific progress is not impeded.
 so same thickness works for booster ship for hoop stress. Booster lower tank will have longitudinal stiffeners to prevent buckling.





 coming soon


 but I suspect its best case will be more costly than wind solar (aka big fusion reactor in sky)







 but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth predictable. Public market does *not* like erratic cash flow haha. I‚Äôm a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it.



 not all Tesla. We do see Tesla reaching 20M vehicles/year probably before 2030 but that requires consistently excellent execution.

 six years maybe. Five years is possible but unlikely. An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials.


 paintball machine gun mounted on the bed rails?

 at least for now. Also maybe the presentation wasn‚Äôt clear that we‚Äôve actually had our cells in packs driving cars for several months. Prototypes are trivial volume production is hard.
 then sure


 but if you head to a Tesla delivery center near you maybe help out new owners that would be cool

 the flaps are now directly driven by electric motors with a gearbox! No more hydraulics.
Thanks Tesla Team for great work on deliveries! For new owners we super appreciate accommodating us on delivery timing! Definitely one of our toughest quarters in global logistics.


 some 301. Broke at 301 to 304 interface. SN9 will be all 304. Also we‚Äôre making some tweaks to the 304 alloy mixture.
 9 bar at base due to propellant head. It‚Äôs enough. Improvements in work.
 then add heat shield go high Mach.
First flight is to 15km or ~50000 ft
Nosecone front flaps next week. SN9 next month.
Starship SN8 with rear body flaps 







Centaur with a bow obviously 




 but I agree with Turok/Feldbrugge/Lehners


 it could be a little bigger. 380 sec Isp would be nice.
 given 330 bar max demonstrated chamber pressure.

 then main chamber

 but besides that what?

 but might not need it

Only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid 











Cybertruck ATV Roadster Semi C A R S 

 but probably above that next few years




The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. It‚Äôs 1000% to 10000% harder than making a few prototypes. The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself.

We intend to increase not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic LG CATL (possibly other partners too). However even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 beyond unless we also take action ourselves.
Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow. This affects long-term production especially Semi Cybertruck Roadster but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.


 all flaps will fold after landing to reduce wind tip over force. There may be some cases where flaps deployed help stability (change in wind direction) in which case one or more flaps will extend.
 we‚Äôll do it already üòÄ
 although I think we should wait until FSD is a bit more mature







 we will open Dojo for training as a web service once we work out the bugs
 but not with regular computing which expects extreme precision.
 not a GPU cluster. Could be wrong but I think it will be best in world.

 we‚Äôre betting on FP16 with floating floating point (essentially truncating mostly zeroes) so it feels like FP32 existing software just works. We considered FP8 for a while but everyone hated it. I even asked Twitter! For inference int8 works great.


 but building itself is continuous. The ‚Äúopen‚Äù areas inside are covered. They‚Äôre internal semi truck roads inside a giant monolithic building.

A prior track record of exceptional achievement in engineering *is* required but *no* prior experience working on the brain or human physiology is required. We will teach you what‚Äôs known about the brain which is not much tbh.

Speedrunning Factorio in real life 
 but you make some great points. Important to note that iron‚Äôs cost advantage is partly offset by increased pack mass so the fully considered cost is closer to nickel. That said iron alleviates much of the scaling problem.

 but probably mid teens. Booster stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors. We‚Äôll build several ships just to improve the production system.

 mostly in series increasingly in parallel. Every product line new production system was invented. Instead of playing chess with the same pieces as everyone else create new pieces.

Tesla Model S X have hospital-grade (HEPA) air filters. 3 Y are really good too. This has a big effect on health. 


 so their compensation increased proportionately. You are a modern day moron.

 outer 20 will have ~300 tons of thrust inner 8 ~210 so roughly 7500 tons total at sea level or 1.5 T/W for booster+ship


 the high thrust variant of Raptor will probably have the high T/W of any engine ever.



 sir I think I have momentinertiaphobia


 straight or circular I know some people 

 everything else is a recommendation
 that would be great! It‚Äôs so much work to create our own tech. We develop new tech because we have to not because we want to.
 but subject to some CureVac IP they could be made for other companies too
 James Watt measured a pony added 50% rounded up haha 
 Critical Thinking

 I super loved astronomy (but took it at Queens not Penn)! Definitely one of my favorite classes. Senior year quantum mechanics at Penn was the hardest class I ever took. That stuff will mess with your mind.
 he sent it to me through a mutual physics prof friend at Caltech/CERN. Very basic stuff. 

Just learned that my physics prof from Penn is head of Fermilab still has some of my old homework ‚ò∫Ô∏è
 the idea of going to the moon is trivial but going to the moon is hard.
 then you have significant mortality risk from many diseases (not just Covid/sars-cov2) that would otherwise have minor effect.

 including some from major medical device companies. Too many testing methods were approved too quickly. Wouldn‚Äôt blame the FDA though. Public was demanding fast test approval.


 nor can we ourselves accurately predict what issues we will encounter on a short-term fine-grained level.

 but maybe for some events
 rather than six


 although the syntax could be improved esthetically
 because it avoids class warfare

Neuralink product demo in 3 hours. Webcast at .
 so this version of the engine can probably sustain ~210 tons. Should have a 250+ ton engine in about 6 to 9 months. Target for booster is 7500 tons (16.5 million pounds) of thrust.
 but yeah Sunday is intense


 SpaceX probably October. We will have made a lot of progress by then. Might have a prototype booster hop done by then.








 although I think it works esthetically. Those are folded-over current collectors at the top/bottom of the cell which are important but I don‚Äôt want to jump the gun on Sept 22 
 so cycle life is usually bad.


The Big Bang started very very sm≈çl

Lengthy background on Neuralink by 
Live webcast of working 


 where the ship itself is the propellant plant. Needs to make ~2 tons/day.
 so an O2 plant on the moon would be enough. Otherwise we could brute-force it with tankers to low Earth orbit. That‚Äôs probably faster.




 but Dojo is de facto FP32 (feels like FP32 but actually FP16 with boring bits truncated) so we don‚Äôt need to rewrite all the training software. It should work almost immediately.



 but frequent (daily) flights probably need ~30km / 18 miles clear area for noise.


 but they just dug their own grave twice as fast!
 produced in volume (not just a lab) is not far. Probably 3 to 4 years.
 which is ~10X mass of Zenit will mostly launch from ocean spaceports long-term

 as Tesla expects to repossess the car. This is essentially a bet on residual value. If you believe residual value will rise buy on loan if you think it will drop then lease.

 but some individual parts like turbine wheels need to be replaced over time. Similar to a jet engine.
 but we‚Äôll support public access whenever it‚Äôs safe secure. Public support is critical to making life multiplanetary.

 but there isn‚Äôt an obvious limit. 100+ flights are possible. Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. Cleaning all 9 Merlin turbines is difficult. Raptor is way easier in this regard despite being a far more complex engine.
 that makes it better though.



Elevator music is underrated
 but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant pump-fed (light tanks) that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!
 so you‚Äôre roughly even with 2 flights definitely ahead with 3
 it will have huge nuts haha
 so adults can squeeze in too. Guaranteed to make a party more fun. Works well with flamethrowers!
 other DoF in compression. New Roadster wheels will only have one nut.

Fairing chute control ship control are closing the loop locally. Both operating on (SpaceX) autopilot.
Ms Tree catches fairing in her net 

 cruising through deep space 




 so they‚Äôre actually quite similar. Both Merlin Raptor could throttle way lower with added design complexity. Raptor preburner Merlin gas generator flameout are what limit lower bound.


 330 bar on Raptor produces ~225 tons (half a million pounds) of force.
Raptor engine just reached 330 bar chamber pressure without exploding! 
 Starship will be a tiny dot at 20km. Hard to see with naked eye. We‚Äôll do lots of flights.
 legs will be bigger there‚Äôll be way more stuff in engine bay. Main engines actually do majority of work in turning ship vertical before landing.

 this is embarrassingly late. Two factor authentication via sms or authenticator app is going through final validation right now.
 so the car can slow down or steer around them when safe to do so.
 but yes. Will take maybe a year or so to get really good at roundabouts worldwide. The world has a zillion weird corner cases.

 using a single pintle injector with cold liquid propellant needs a longer chamber than Raptor which uses a large number of coaxial injectors despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that‚Äôs already mixed.

 plus cryo strength bump of CH4 tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2.
 but even better in practice. With CH4 you can reach &gt;99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency but RP is ~97% on a good day requires desooting of turbines between flights.

Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested I ask that it only be me.

 this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA.

 I do think finance law are important but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also too many MBAs.
 mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)

Starship SN4 tank on test stand 
 same results are showing up pretty much everywhere on Earth. Contagion is higher in high pop density cities mortality proportionate to age.
Silver lining is that mortality rate is much lower than predicted herd immunity much higher. Good news.

 quiet home HVAC with HEPA water distillation. It‚Äôs weird but I really want to do it.


 as meant for self-driving but will review with team. Image will need a little post-processing.
 especially if mostly loans. Oil gas is an important industry without which civilization could not function at this time but financial support should be proportionate to rest of economy.







 it‚Äôs named after my friend Joe who suggested the feature

In advance of this please try to hack Starlink Tesla Mothership!
There are now 420 operational Starlink satellites üõ∞ üòâ

 but nothing‚Äôs as weird as reality!
 so as not to affect the phased array antennas. Looks a lot like a car sun visor.





 much of the stimulus money is questionable but this much to oil gas seems especially so

 we will have put up 422 satellites 





 they recommended against invasive ventilators in favor of non-invasive


 so pretty great :)

 hopefully flaps too. Definitely flaps on SN6






 and whole lot more! Aargh I‚Äôm dying to make Cybertruck like yesterday!!




Best political platform ever 
 which is very difficult. Orbital refilling should in theory be easier since Starships dock with themselves will be uncrewed at first.


 then orbital refilling then Mars

 just as Apollo did. It wasn‚Äôt just that a few people went to the moon they went there for all humankind.
 not latter.


 there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator but *not* invasive that tells you something! This article incorrectly conflates invasive as ‚Äúventilator‚Äù but makes many good points 






 as the design is stable. Depending on how you count them there are about 6 engine stands operating in parallel.
 as the header tanks are quite small relative to main (~30 tons vs 1200 tons). Only uses very tip of the nose.

 oxygen header tank in nose is important to keep center of mass forward during atmospheric entry

 but seemingly small changes can have surprisingly big effects

 will fix
 Remdesivir is sounding very promising!
Orbital human spaceflight returns to the Cape in six weeks!


 so strakes are unlikely. Some very counterintuitive CFD results in both hypersonic subsonic regimes. Starship does controlled falling more than flying.

Good progress but 18 years to launch our first humans is a long time. Technology must advance faster or there will be no city on the red planet in our lifetime. 
 although we also sent some Medtronic units which are meant for extreme situations. Those require a lot of work to set up operate. Should be used sparingly. SpaceX is making the valve at the heart of that system.

 60% empty.


 so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said as lawn ornaments go they‚Äôre pretty sweet 
 so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap actuator static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps.



 especially propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said it‚Äôs probably right move for small LEO vehicle.
 but yes jamming a pipe down a patient‚Äôs throat driving in high pressure pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2. 

 but looks so simple next to Raptor!
 the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!
 Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch
 Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine but not US. Also their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage payload separation system also not US.
 Philips Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation setting PEEP O2 too high. High pressure pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage. 
 meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close but not yet 100%.
 not govt. Without that Daimler support Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!
 Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010 long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!
 over a million dollars less. Moreover F9 is launching far more often is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts so that gap is increasing.
 it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That‚Äôs the acid test.
 they‚Äôd be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying.
To be clear Fremont Shanghai will also be upgraded over time but it‚Äôs hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop
Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y

 but we will give it our best shot!
Giga Berlin will have world‚Äôs most advanced paint shop with more layers of stunning colors that subtly change with curvature


 our product plan is basically stolen from Spaceballs

 this is a real problem. The science is not in doubt.

 it will be as strange to have expendable rockets as it would be to have expendable airplanes today. All will be reusable.

 as SpaceX lands on land frequently. Russia has very talented engineers but they must be given reusability as goal or success is impossible.


 theirs are 0%. This is the actual problem.

 we‚Äôre going to reuse much of the thrust section.
 so got to make the core ship super safe.
 so maintaining pressure is fundamental. However this can be made very safe over time imo.

 you‚Äôre doomed anyway so might as well go all in
We‚Äôre adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the Tesla!
 rather than a design or build mistake. Not enough pressure in the LOX tank ullage to maintain stability with a heavy load in the CH4 tank. This was done with N2.

 good point. Will discuss with team make available to buy in Tesla app.

 but this may have been a test configuration mistake








 now doing cryogenic

 very important to provide C/BiPAP devices to *prevent* cases from becoming severe. Once severe (intratracheal intubation) survival rates are low.
 as Gov Cuomo has pointed out. Nonetheless we start delivery of intratracheal Medtronic units in NYC tonight.
 all hospitals were given exact specifications of Resmed Philips ventilators before delivery all confirmed they would be critical.




 v close! Nice work. Those are V0.9 legs so major upgrades coming. Need wider span longer stroke ability to auto-level for uneven ground or leaning into high winds.

 especially body castings heat pump

 but over time it will be ~150t to LEO fully reusable
We have extra FDA-approved ventilators. Will ship to hospitals worldwide within Tesla delivery regions. Device shipping cost are free. Only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients not stored in a warehouse. Please me or 
 so are longer than they seem but not as long as they will be for SN4+

Hello from the Inside 
Logarithm graphs coming soon 

 due to fear of giving or receiving C19



Would be great to combine blood donations with a C19 antibody test so you know if you‚Äôre immune. Refill blood banks give donors peace of mind.


 whether we buy them or build them
 the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed.
 but stuck in logistics/routing/paperwork issues.







 we‚Äôre delivering Resmed Philips Medtronic ventilators to NY hospitals starting tonight.


 everything else is a recommendation
SN3 





This meme proves it 
It‚Äôs ducked!
.
 this is accurate. You believe in journalistic integrity but if something isn‚Äôt done this will continue.



 fresh water just dump it on the ground.
 China Customs Authority LAX customs for acting so swiftly
 China had an oversupply so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed Philips Medtronic ventilators on Friday night airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed please let us know!
 pretty much. House could talk to car know when you‚Äôre expected home so temp humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy.

 with humidity control HEPA filter





 imo we will see a significant reduction in the confirmed C19 case growth rate this week. Follow chart at bottom of this CDC page: 

 only 12% of deaths are actually due to C19. This is a significant policy difference in Italy vs most other countries.










 installed operating is the harder part.



 only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus.‚Äù
 who have almost no risk of C19 death with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage) are one of the most powerful mortality vectors

Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team!

 regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point we have strict containment in US/Europe should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China.
 followed by sigmoidal for rest of world

 both would be false positive. Also dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too. 

 although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also using CPAP machines for less severe cases using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand.



 pump pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care avoid cross-flow risk
 SpaceX is working on ventilators too
 so no our US factory can‚Äôt stay open
 we‚Äôre working on ventilators even though I think they probably won‚Äôt be needed



 even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter
 even with family members for now. Those seem most important.

 but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids grandparents probably most risky.
 probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April

No new domestic corona cases in China 
 this professor is correct. Also growth rate of confirmed C19 cases is dropping every day despite 10X increase in testing. From Tues to today was 43%24% 17%. Track this chart: 
 we will connect with your team to understand potential needs


 if that hasn‚Äôt happened already.
 but cannot be produced instantly. Which hospitals have these shortages you speak of right now?



 not oft-reported ‚Äúpresumptive positive‚Äù is trending to level off over next few weeks be negligible by end of April. Same pattern as China.  



 that will be a great milestone üòÄ
 but not obviously related to today. This vehicle has seen a lot of wear so today isn‚Äôt a big surprise. Life leader rockets are used only for internal missions. Won‚Äôt risk non-SpaceX satellites.
 most reflights ever!
 but it didn‚Äôt affect orbit insertion. Shows value of having 9 engines! Thorough investigation needed before next mission.

 I received chloroquine via central line through my chest both arms. Had near fatal case of falciparum. Would‚Äôve died for sure if not for chloroquine. Doesn‚Äôt mean it works for C19 but maybe better than nothing.

The degree to which SolarGlass will positively effect the esthetics energy sustainability of neighborhoods throughout the world is not yet well appreciated. This is a very important product.
Tesla April company talk will be from our Giga New York factory where we make SolarGlass several other products. Will also offer customer media tours.
Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It‚Äôs stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don‚Äôt do it justice.
 so should be light enough for almost any home

 but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!
 so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so it‚Äôs very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles.



Please let us know what improvements we can make to any aspect of Tesla SolarGlass roof! Critical feedback is much appreciated.

 they‚Äôre SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time.
 we‚Äôre tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering building a heavy duty planisher to flatten cold work the weld area
 although substantial capital engineering is required to achieve extreme precision marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower because it‚Äôs built inside a factory in volume.
 so super precise parts fixtures welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.

 we need to make it super safe easy to use then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards.
 we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world so this shouldn‚Äôt be thought of as USA only. Also work location can be Bay Area (preferred) but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory.
 that should be straightforward to address but there could be complexities I‚Äôm unaware of
 it has general applications beyond fast high precision micro-electrode insertion that automatically avoids the vasculature
 but the potential is truly transformational for restoring brain motor functions. There is no other way to do it imo.


 it looks like a medieval torture device but is nonetheless currently used in many human studies! Not hard to be way better.

Our NN is initially in Python for rapid iteration then converted to C++/C/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). Also tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant but all must pass hardcore coding test.
 high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array which is already in some humans has severe drawbacks.


 but will be very useful on Mars due to light speed latency

We are trapped in a prison of fonts


 but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However the tanks do expand under pressure creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4.

 which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts better welding conditions we should reach ~8.5 bar which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight.

 this is something Tesla should do

Cybertruck is our last product unveil for a while but there will be some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements next year
 but it also gets cold-worked many times depending on kilotonnage of press.


 it probably makes sense to build a smaller Cybertruck too





 but then I‚Äôm confident it will actually cost less because of its simplicity lower part count.

 but we‚Äôll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods as it can‚Äôt be made using standard methods.
 but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger.
Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend which is how the prototype was made
Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can‚Äôt stamp ultra-hard 30X steel because it breaks the stamping press

 so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100000 tons/year.
 although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight especially on Super Heavy which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!

 than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event however far in the future that may be (hopefully very far).
 in the beginning assuming you even make it there alive Mars will be far more dangerous difficult than Earth take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That‚Äôs the sales pitch. Want to go?
 which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable



 of which Falcon is about half
 so ~100 vehicles each does 100 tons to orbit that‚Äôs a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year

 autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software.



 most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels especially for frequent daily flights as would occur for point to point flights on Earth
 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery Falcon is ~80% reusable but reflight takes several days requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.

Great work by SpaceX Dragon team Airborne! To be clear we‚Äôve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row.
 as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called ‚ÄúLow Gear‚Äù!
Tesla Solarglass vs üéÉ Happy Halloween!! 
 Drag Times is correct Top Gear is wrong
 there‚Äôs a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 1/4 mile races.

 we‚Äôre keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation so that‚Äôs leaving a lot on the table
 but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.

 r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude which is ~6800km from center of Earth.

 Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist.
Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid
V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout.
 ie robotaxi you‚Äôll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many much better than driving a single car.

 it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear so long as within bounds of center of mass pressure.
 which I‚Äôm not fully bought into suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2
 as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward ‚Äúfin‚Äù would simply be used as a leg.

 cold gas attitude control thrusters header tanks for landing composite pressure vessels several large batteries etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors rear fins at the bottom.
 which is why we haven‚Äôt closed it out.

However we won‚Äôt customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla customer legal bill to be high drag things out. Pay for clean power not lawyers! It makes way more sense.
Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at .
 batteries drive units for the greater China area. Over time regional Gigafactories will lower costs improve logistics worldwide.
 eg UK Ireland right now but we don‚Äôt raise the prices even so. The intent at any given moment in time is: heads we lose tails buyers win.
 which is why I‚Äôm looking into it
 there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions due to planning mistakes logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.
 while they may change will change for all equally should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.

 then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.
 just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle however is same deal for all.
 ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.

 as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful) but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.

 so if t is small you haven‚Äôt moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust you‚Äôll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low as ox fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it you‚Äôre prob ok.

As mentioned earlier this year cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit.


Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
 your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can‚Äôt make enough of them we won‚Äôt be able to.
 since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers
 as planned any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week

 consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla but the clearing price will rise significantly as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car

 but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms ü§ó

 they run at *much* higher pressure but lower temperature. Thermal shock strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability but better to apply that engineering to Raptor.
 although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more




 we‚Äôve been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous.
 like an aircraft jet engine with inspections required only after many flights assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps.



 but no throttling to get to 250 mT level
 cost per ton would be $1000. However Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1.

 sub 10ms over time with much greater consistency than terrestrial links as only ever a few hops to major data centers
 that‚Äôs easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw as shown by this NASA density map.  
 which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won‚Äôt be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible. 
 Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency.



 but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars.
 so propellant density thrust increase up to ~8% as needed for mission. 380 Isp up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1 but Raptor is closer to optimum.

 there was a major change in last several months. Everyone noticed Fred. Hello.



 how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez 
 every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about 0 injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article misleading readers into thinking EV‚Äôs have high fire risk when opposite is true.
 support super appreciated

When you read double standard articles about Tesla please ask why. Maybe there‚Äôs a good reason that isn‚Äôt obvious.
Reality is a Tesla like most electric cars is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?
Over a million combustion engine (it‚Äôs right there in the name!) car fires per year thousands of deaths but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question.
Those who predicted Tesla EVs would be dead autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?
Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars autonomy was between 10 years never 

 about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year.
 probably closer to 16 hours accounting for empty legs travel to charger/cleaning/service wait times etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost battery wear cost larger range pack needed.







 that too
 you can‚Äôt actually use computation from a separate GPU effectively as you get choked on the bus so most of the computation is irrelevant. High power high cooling but low true usable TOPS. Worst of all worlds.

 Fred but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They can‚Äôt *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ expos√© pieces on oil coal gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they‚Äôre all angels 
 this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false.

 which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now it‚Äôs slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer as our software is more refined for HW2.

Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 HW3. Going forward ‚ÄúHW3‚Äù will just be called FSD Computer which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important.

 as batch builds ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month terrible following month but consumer tastes don‚Äôt actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules.
 as countries have different regulations we try to build in batches to simplify production
 but def before end of summer
 especially with silicon carbide inverter is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses then range of dual might be higher but that‚Äôs a lot of complexity.
 better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD but it isn‚Äôt critical for snowy regions.

 lower price shouldn‚Äôt have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn‚Äôt afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday.
 this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak
 just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference ‚Äî about half as many stores closed but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team board.
 those who already bought want the lower price but if prices go up those who already bought don‚Äôt want to write Tesla a check. So it goes.

Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput.
Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to 25% for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide incl original 2012 Model S. Not splitting power across 2 Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to 50%.

 that was a bit embarrassing ‚ò∫Ô∏èHigh engine chamber pressure and ablative don‚Äôt get along. Ok for low pressure expendable upper stage.
 1D good but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there.
 they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for ‚Äúlaunch capability‚Äù. Even if they do zero launches US govt still gives them that.

 they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years. 
 but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X humanity will never be a multiplanet species.
 but it has world record for thrust/weight thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp but I‚Äôm worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.

Testing metallic heat shield at 1100C (2000F) 

 we need to be better at remembering brightness settings.


If test flight of üêâ goes well next month 

 ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.

 as it can take ~1450 Kelvin so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp

 all cars with AP2+ hardware will get it
Tesla Sentry Mode coming soon for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot
 despite high outside heat rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze block cooling channels.

 specific heat is more important than latent heat of vaporization which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water

 the whole referral incentive system will end
The Tesla customer referral program will end on Feb 1. If you want to refer a friend to buy a Tesla give them 6 months of free Supercharging please do so before then.

 but it‚Äôs not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or Mars so we decided not to qualify it for thruster landings

 but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX
 but in this case it was our miscommunication
 CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas as their size makes them very difficult to transport.

 so probably around $750M plus maybe $50M/station

Yes. Supercharger coverage will extend to 100% of Europe next year. From Ireland to Kiev from Norway to Turkey.
Most people don‚Äôt know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA most of Europe Canada and China 



 as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car.
Most importantly every electric car Tesla or otherwise matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric the future gets a little bit brighter! If not Tesla please take a look at these other options: 
And because electricity costs much less than gasoline a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it‚Äôs electric there are no oil changes smog checks tuneups fuel filter or brake pad replacements.
There are also many state local incentives for example California offers $2500 plus $800 from utilities access to carpool lane Colorado $4000 etc

Stainless Steel Starship 



At SpaceX Boca Chica launch site in Texas 
Amazing space progress by China. This year they did more orbital launches than the USA for the first time.
Engineering is true magic



Please put ‚Äúinvented car fart‚Äù on my gravestone. This is my only request.

 hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions.

 but that engine design is brilliant
000 horsepower per engine. That‚Äôs not a typo.
 full flow gas-gas staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to 300 bar. That is a mad level.

 no problem.
 V2+ on Starship. Basically all future products will contain either the word ‚Äústar‚Äù or ‚Äúlink‚Äù üòÄ
 but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth due to deep gravity well thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons Mars.

 just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height diameter.


 at supplier made to our spec. For cast in our Hawthorne foundry.

 so hopefully March/April
 the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel we‚Äôre using a different alloy mix. I super ‚ô•Ô∏è 300 Series Stainless!
 Starship is very different from the Atlas design
 but different mixture of alloys new architecture. Unlike Atlas Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized.
 Tesla will cover the tax credit difference

 but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model 3 orders delivered by year end

Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer can‚Äôt take delivery before year end as well as test drive / display cars which cost less. Reminder to US buyers that $7500 tax credit drops in half in 8 days. Order online at  or visit stores.

 there is probably a good safety argument.
 but it was confusing so I didn‚Äôt include it. We‚Äôre working on one that makes things clear.
 park and walk!

If all vehicles were densely seated buses throughput in excess of 100000 people per hour per lane is possible but better to offer a range of vehicles let people decide what makes them happy

Also Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)
Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks.  To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car order at  or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla can‚Äôt deliver your car this year.



Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself even if they don‚Äôt believe in climate change.  Not everyone can be convinced about global warming but if an electric car is simply the best product they don‚Äôt need to be.

 but has over 10X the image processing ability.
Already testing traffic lights stop signs roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all.
If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars takes highway interchanges off-ramps.

 but that was a dumb decision. In the end Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car.
Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that Tesla wouldn‚Äôt exist or would have started much later. 
 we wanted to name our company after Tesla the great scientist/engineer but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US Europe later China.
 $11M amazing amount of effort. Didn‚Äôt like  even when we were only making üöò.
Tesla history trivia: we didn‚Äôt actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He‚Äôd originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday which was used by a competitor several years later.
 but demo Starship is being built now whereas Super Heavy hardware will start getting built in spring

Cool! Actually if you buy a Tesla without a test drive you have 3 days to return it. If you buy after a test drive you still have 24 hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive.

üöÄ Starships were meant to fly üöÄ

Technically two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth‚Äôs deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)
Renaming BFR to Starship
 we‚Äôre just going to accelerate BFR

Supercharger V3 which starts rolling out early next year will also charge much faster
Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
 it‚Äôs got enough load capacity volume to carry the battery pack our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort all things considered.
 but not necessarily production ramp as that depends on thousands of parts processes which are extremely difficult to forecast
 not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.
 so it‚Äôs either get van gliders (no battery powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler produce sooner or do all produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y solar roof tiles pickup semi Roadster.






 but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not.

 but perhaps in a few years
 good idea. We have that state internally so can push data to phone app.

Will allow having your car picked up dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn‚Äôt needed
Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps
 no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only provided NASA USAF are supportive.

Btw SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive.

Set air flow to recirculating mode manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times.

It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example as a pot of water becomes colder it becomes inert ice but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler.

 technically mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient decayed marine organisms partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)
Makes me so mad when smart ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for ‚Äúgrant money‚Äù. They earn ü•ú vs their other opportunities but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?
 but move rapidly towards clean sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term but will make them stronger long-term.
We know we‚Äôll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel have to use sustainable energy eventually so why not go renewable now avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far 

 but not hospital grade. S X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3.

 partial presence in India Africa South America end of next year with broader expansion in 2020
 Eastern Europe China Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases.
 the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible.
 as we do today in California Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally most likely from several companies (incl Pana) in order to meet demand in a timely manner.

 aiming for next few months
 but this will improve dramatically over next several months all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time.
Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
Just reviewed Tesla‚Äôs service locations in North America realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.

 shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative ‚Äî it incents negative gdp! Moreover it stops private companies from going public preventing access by retirement funds small investors thus increasing wealth divide.

 thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners who‚Äôd like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centers during midday on Sat/Sun morning/evening on weekdays that would be super appreciated!

 though commonly asked isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front 50% on rear still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad spinning top/dreidel is good.

 to the extent of our knowledge is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety handling driving feel. Extremely important metric.

 when it comes to physics make sure Newton is on your side

 it‚Äôs not really sustainable at volume production doesn‚Äôt incent optimal behavior. We probably should have ended this earlier.

 that‚Äôs our problem. Service parts supply in general will be the top Tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks.
 which means supporting 1000‚Äôs of makes models. Tesla collision repair specializes in three. Having all parts in stock not waiting for insurance approval also make a world of difference.
Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.
Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within 24 hrs. Aiming for same day soon then under an hour.
Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy

 I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes.

 the ‚Äúbillionaire‚Äù label when used by media is almost always meant to devalue denigrate the subject. I wasn‚Äôt called that until my companies got to a certain size but reality is that I still do the same science engineering as before. Just the scale has changed.
 particularly if water toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present as patient would remain dry at std air pressure entire time.
 it was specifically designed to pass that point
 based on extensive cave video review discussion with several divers who know journey SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey demonstrate at any time.

Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!

Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts named Wild Boar after kids‚Äô soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful.

With some mods this could also work as an escape pod in space


 so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave then add weight belts for wet sections.
 that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio phone/music player.

 allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops.

 then 17 hour flight to Thailand
Continue to be amazed by the bravery resilience tenacity of kids diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best.
Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust.



Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work given tricky contours but great if it does.

 then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary less susceptible to panic attack.

 that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about in that tweet ‚Äî double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying.


 unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping suggests that leak holes are not large.



 thanks

 air will blow out water won‚Äôt come in
 only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed.

 air pumps tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube zip up then transit.
 tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power.

 but if you‚Äôre in an air tube time doesn‚Äôt matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections.

 Tesla‚Äôs most prominent short-seller. In her words he is ‚Äúone of the greatest.‚Äù Her articles print Chanos‚Äôs view verbatim. This is not journalism.
 the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?


 very simple question. To be specific: did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he under that inducement provide you with exaggerated negative info which you printed but turned out to be untrue?
 I just asked a simple question. Please answer.
 is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst‚Äôs track record before hearing their opinion.
Note no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself. 
 is it possible you‚Äôre serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla‚Äôs biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?
 including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total SX 3 production number which is physically impossible.
 so 
 why did you mislead the people public about this number?
 ie 1900/week. Tesla built 1913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week which is right on target.

 I built model airplanes trainsets rockets (mixed my own powder) explosives (kinda surprised I still have all fingers) a radio lots of software. Built a primitive MRI machine in college.

 consumption tax is way better. Also higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high.

 but that does not mean low causation.

 for example is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what ‚Äúmoney‚Äù is.
 all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced above 50% too negatively affects economic output.

 we are California which is extremely pro union. People can form a union tomorrow nothing Tesla could do to stop it. UAW can‚Äôt even get enough sigs to request a vote cause they have nothing to offer.


 good advice



 hourly wages above union Tesla stock. Also free drinks snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW so UAW keeps trashing Tesla me via 3rd parties.

 I think we pretty much agree. Btw great show.
 incl health care should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka the view held by most of America.

 so they‚Äôre getting desperate.

 as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants so must be doing something right.
 they‚Äôre getting paid trolls far left shills to trash Tesla me in press social media. Such creeps.
 but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can‚Äôt compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don‚Äôt want Tesla to die too.

Difficult but necessary Tesla reorg underway. My email to the company has already leaked to media. Here it is unfiltered: 



 but it‚Äôs the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing we‚Äôre never going to make them again.
 which is prob wise for many reasons
 but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It‚Äôs what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust ‚Äî literally bulletproof.


 not carefully crafted corporate bs which is really just banal propaganda.



 negatively affecting safety but also can‚Äôt allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially.

 I‚Äôm not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke but is about the right actual timing.

 pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too but there‚Äôs no escaping Newton‚Äôs Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha.
 Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive there is no finer car in history and we don‚Äôt think there will be another.
 gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump which is most of the time.
 no exceptions thus transferring the ‚Äúhalo crown‚Äù effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric.
 Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9 we will begin to enable full self-driving features.
This is why I‚Äôm not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked then I‚Äôd know everything‚Äôs fine no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh ü§î
Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional city papers online for the first time and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times Boston Globe Knight-Ridder websites. NYT KR Hearst were all major investors in Zip2.

 I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU CD-ROM to act in parallel so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++ assembly direct flipping of CPU registers. That company‚Äôs name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony.
 I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014 we open-sourced all Tesla patents 
At Zip2 I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so) as well as white pages business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds autotrading real estate apps.
More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000 a backpack a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro Greg Khouri (love bro loved Greg may he RIP)
 but The Boring Company is donating $10k.
 plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV when car power draw drops below max pack power output makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further.
19 years ago when my 1st company got bought I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way
SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration top speed braking cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly

 let‚Äôs test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them wages were lower. Maybe. Let‚Äôs hold a vote find out.
 but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM Chrysler to bankruptcy lost 200000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry everyone knows it.
We‚Äôre going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S X 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?

 UAW does that. They want divisiveness enforcement of 2 class ‚Äúlords commoners‚Äù system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much.
 most stringent labor safety org in US they‚Äôve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand Ford Chrysler GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely that info is missing from Reveal article 

 nor have we ever been scheduled to meet.
 have conveyed your words to the Tesla team who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!


Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
 but on the higher body/chassis weight front he wasn‚Äôt fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars.
 no matter how nuanced.
 all Model 3 cars incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product however is that if you care about perfection you make constant small refinements. Today‚Äôs Model S is far more refined than initial production.

 Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort lower wind noise many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production.
 we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won‚Äôt stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car.
 you‚Äôre making me blush ‚ò∫Ô∏è
 not promising anything but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little

 we will do that for the bigger locations.
 but might indicate that some Model 3‚Äôs have longer braking distances than others. If so we will address this at our expense. First time we‚Äôve seen anything like this.
 we will make sure all Model 3‚Äôs having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers
 we will figure it out address. May just be a question of firmware tuning in which case can be solved by an OTA software update.
 we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers beeping forklifts you said didn‚Äôt exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar


 UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving but everything to do with why people here have jobs.

 but were reported as ‚Äúfacts‚Äù by Reveal.

Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front a motor in rear. One is optimized for power one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination don‚Äôt get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec top speed to 140 mph.

Tesla AWD is dual motor so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks
Cost of all options wheels paint etc is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3 but 15% quicker with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track.

 but so far it appears so
 but perfect is enemy of good. A system that on balance saves lives reduces injuries should be released.
What‚Äôs actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
It‚Äôs super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage 

 there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It‚Äôs not possible to be zero but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter.
 not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg.

 but we‚Äôre fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising.

 I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them.
 as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory not the showroom.
Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations despite no advertising no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0.
The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand along with details in the body of the letter
The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis not investors

First it‚Äôs important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market has been for a while 
Please ignore this thread unless you‚Äôre interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock

 news is actually super good. Model S X are producing major positive cash flow Model 3 is about to do same.
 I‚Äôm a big fan of MKBHD but this is an important clarification
 but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors so I switched to them.

On the Westworld set with my bro 
Why Falcon Heavy Starman? Life cannot just be about solving one sad problem after another. There need to be things that inspire you that make you glad to wake up in the morning and be part of humanity. That is why we did it. We did for you.  

 it‚Äôs not

Tunnels

 underground autonomous electric bus that automatically switches between tunnels and lifts. So yes a bus.
Better video coming soon but it would look a bit like this: 
Boring Co urban loop system would have 1000‚Äôs of small stations the size of a single parking space that take you very close to your destination blend seamlessly into the fabric of a city rather than a small number of big stations like a subway

Will still transport cars but only after all personalized mass transit needs are met. It‚Äôs a matter of courtesy fairness. If someone can‚Äôt afford a car they should go first.

 I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing.
 ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable.
 but the current rules make things very difficult. It‚Äôs like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes.
 no US auto company is allowed to own even 50% of their own factory in China but there are five 100% China-owned EV auto companies in the US
 an American car going to China pays 25% import duty but a Chinese car coming to the US only pays 2.5% a tenfold difference
 same import duties ownership constraints other factors.

Want to clarify that as individuals the people responsible for the high costs long timelines are almost all well-meaning but the system of incentives is messed up
Higher safety environmental requirements labor costs explain only a small part of the difference. True root cause imo is an exponential growth in bureaucracy a self-serving private sector consultant industry earning a % on project cost incenting them to maximize cost.

 flying soon also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be will if BFR takes longer than expected.
 so around $95M.


 but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before 2023
 before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high.
 but mass ratio and thrust are not.
 a fully expendable Falcon Heavy which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy is $150M compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy.

 public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this but we need much better tunneling technology as it is currently super slow and expensive.
 but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out.
 I actually love trains most subways and London buses.
 but aren‚Äôt (having ‚ÄúPhD‚Äù in their bio is a dead giveaway) as some policymakers may get fooled. That‚Äôs what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit ‚Äúexpert‚Äù.

 but it's time you admitted you are one of the creators of the next one. Everyone already knows and we will still love you just as much (almost).

 even our primitive sims are often more entertaining than reality itself.
 but there is no scalability limit so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt PUC any commercial stakeholders and most importantly the people of PR.

I believe I can fly 
Aiming for two rocket landings in 48 hours this weekend

Btw high accel only needed because tube is short. For passenger transport this can be spread over 20+ miles so no spilt drinks.
 so actually yes

Might be possible to go supersonic in our test Hyperloop tube even though it's only 0.8 miles long. Very high accel/decel needed

From last year but still my favorite video of the Falcon 9 rocket booster returning from space 


 Gary on Sunday




Max recovered booster velocity was Mach 7.9 (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared so this is a bigger difference than it appears
Max velocity: Mach 6.9 Max altitude: 247 km Highest so far but velocity matters much more




Touchdown: Vertical Velocity (m/s): -1.47 Lateral Velocity (m/s): -0.15 Tilt (deg): 0.40 ‚Äã Lateral position: 0.7m from target center

 we need to make it a lot easier to adjust the headrest.
 it should probably automatically adjust to the user config of whoever is closest to a given door when the handle is touched


But you can check it out on this isn't a video like cliff diving or fake rocket landings that matters if it's reversed.
Wigs me out too much. Deleting 
 just that the permitting process is slow

Tesla Powerwalls can support houses of any size but the cool thing is we can tow this house around with a Model X!

Nobody likes being regulated but everything (cars planes food drugs etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too.

Thoughtful Model 3 review by one of the most insightful journalists 
 but I liked those best

 it's better than a Model 3. We can put a lot more in a car at a higher price.
 which is just take the pain and make sure you really care about what you're doing
 it isn't fair to blame hell 
 so maybe real problem is getting carried away in what I sign up for.

Often comes as a surprise when people learn that 80% of my time is on engineering/design and just 20% on other stuff 

 I postponed publishing in order to present the updated interplanetary rocket spaceship design in Adelaide. Will be on the final day.
Discussing physics of tunnels with Mayor Vargas (who has a physics background). Hawthorne support for The Boring Company much appreciated. 


 written approval but this opens door for state city discussions.

 so I think it is he right way to go

If you want this to happen fast please let your local federal elected representatives know. Makes a big difference if they hear from you.
Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval but am optimistic that will occur rapidly


City center to city center in each case with up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city

I should clarify: Tesla stock is obviously high based on past present but low if you believe in Tesla's future. Place bets accordingly  
 otherwise hard to find them

 so fine by me
 but I made it this way for those who care and understand. Source and appearance are the same.
It's what you don't say


Fixed. Now it's good.



Excited to announce the launch of ! It's a little verbose right now but that will be fixed tomorrow.

 China manufacturing quality is excellent. Among other things that's where iPhones many Android phones most laptops are made.
Another SpaceX launch today if weather is good 

Sorry to hear about China launch failure today. I know how painful that is to the people who designed built it.

Just try one. It's way better than you think.


Not as much as tunnels though
They are so underappreciated
They will never let you down
I love floors

 but I am
No longer waiting for Godot. It has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in LA.
Good summary of rocket landing history. There were two successful water landings much earlier but they didn't survive long. 
 so a Mach 8 reentry is 8X Mach 4. Intense.

Sped up version of today's rocket landing on the Droneship Just Read the Instructions (guess it 

 they will not even be repainted between launches. Aiming to be able to relaunch same orbital rocket booster in &lt;24 hours.

New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.


Launch at 1:25 delivering 10 satellites for Iridium. Droneship repositioned due to extreme weather. Will be tight. 
Closeup of the titanium grid fins. Not painted as they glow red hot during a fast reentry. 
 but that was upgraded to closed about 2 years ago
 it has all the wifis and 3G is coming soon

 but that's a minor factor for rockets
 but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy but also enables Falcon 9 to land in heavier winds.
 but the hydraulic system is closed loop so no fluid lost. They do need more power energy but rocket has plenty of that.
 but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups
Flying with larger significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding. 

 so only a couple of hours to replace
Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core) but otherwise good
Falcon 9 will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.

Worth watching Who Killed the Electric Car? By 
 it's on
 almost all will disconnect from the electricity grid.
 which is the world leader in EV adoption! Great example for the rest of the world.
 but we've convinced most of the auto industry to start EV programs gave them all our patents to help so that's something
Nothing to do w govt incentives or making money. Thought 90% prob of losing it all (almost did many times) but it was the only chance.
Since big car companies were killing their EV programs the only chance was to create an EV company even tho it was almost certain to fail
They was done against the will of their owners who held a candlelight vigil all night to protest the death of their cars
Few people know that we started Tesla when GM forcibly recalled all electric cars from customers in 2003 then crushed them in a junkyard


 will add cancel nav to voice commands


 I cracked a long time ago. That's not news. Second yes I can see time. How did you know?
 car should auto play when it gets an exact match like it does for directions. Will make that change.


 it's not!


Just tap the voice button on the steering wheel and say Play Monty Python or Navigate home or anything. Voice commands work pretty well.
 SUV has more room.
 coming back







In the US you can ask your Tesla to play any Monty Python (or other comedy) skit. Doesn't work outside US yet.
 so you get it on your phone if you have a Powerwall or Tesla solar.

Try the new Tesla DJ station on streaming radio

Probably closer to 2030 to 2040 imo. 2060 would be a linear extrapolation but progress is exponential.

Comparing Model S vs Model 3 
Old-school fidget spinner back when the only things to play with were squirrels and rocks 

Btw that cloud is almost entirely steam including dark parts (like a storm). This is what the launch looks like: 
Falcon Heavy is this times three. One way or another launch is guaranteed to be exciting  






Feel exactly the same way as A.O. Scott. Particularly loved The Spy Who Loved Me 



 we're making the simplest Model 3 first like we did with S. Didn't do it with X because I was an idiot.

 but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian cyclist safety






 should you get a 3.
 but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that.
 control algorithm is safe but unpleasant. New one is even safer but super smooth.
 plus much improved web browser


 but that would beg the question of why you turned it off :)

Excited about the Tesla Autopilot software release rolling out next month. New control algorithm feels as smooth as silk.
 Model X Model S will all have same level of Autopilot capability. It's just a matter of refining the vision control software.

 I already said we'd add more independent members during SCTY merger. Will announce soon but this group has nothing to do with it.

Autolist survey finds Tesla used car values are highest and sell fastest 
 but that should be reusable this year. Am fairly confident we can reuse upper stage too by late next year to get to 100%.

Feature coming soon that allows one touch access to all discovered Tesla Easter eggs 
And so the robots spared humanity

Why did we waste so much time developing silly rockets? Damn you aliens! So obtuse! You have all this crazy tech but can't speak English!?

Falcon Heavy test flight currently scheduled for late summer

Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milestone in space! Next goal is reflight within 24 hours.

Long Neuralink piece coming out on but existential risk is too high not to.









 probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though due to having more space for a larger battery.
 more cargo space plus higher range acceleration two screens vs one auto extend handles 

 it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week.

 really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can.

 which is probably in 6 to 9 months.

 machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!

 we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production just like Model S.



 which is a few years away.
 but not until next year

 but much faster more storage space + Autopilot




Model 3 was going to be called Model E for obvious dumb humor reasons but Ford sued to block it so now it is S3X. Totally different :)

Model 3 is just a smaller more affordable version of Model S w less range power fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology.
Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the next version of a Tesla like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true.

 at least. Hope it's a bit useful.


 simulation great filter or they are very very subtle.

Finally an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense  

 but prob 10 days or so depending on full speed autosteer test results
 but LotR is my favorite book ever :) Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ.
 so there is complete transparency.
. and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches
Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan especially 

 which kinda digitizes DC power

Ironically direct current is the right approach today even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power electronics both DC.
You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC. 
 Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart quick solution.
 but shipping taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country as those costs are beyond our control




Thanks JJ!
Thank you for the lovely letter. That sounds like a great idea. We'll do it! 
SpaceX could not do this without NASA. Can't express enough appreciation.

 but in this case we have already retired so much RD risk on Dragon 2 that I feel very confident of 2018.
 so no dedicated pump or fluid needed
Btw 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error) but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day.
 but also not out of the question
If this is the only issue flight would be fine but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause
All systems go except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate.

Our radar is using a wavelength of 3.9mm. A good size for both decent resolution and rain penetration. Am hopeful


Good thing about radar is that unlike lidar (which is visible wavelength) it can see through rain snow fog and dust

If curious abt TSWLM car am still planning to do a sports sub car that can drive on roads. Just a side project. Limited market potential :)
We *def* don't recommended this but Model S floats well enough to turn it into a boat for short periods of time. Thrust via wheel rotation.
Tesla owner drives through a flooded tunnel out the other side  
As mentioned at the beginning of the year I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. 2016 is the year of experimentation.
Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck 
Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines

Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.

RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly :)
Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.

Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
Of greater concern: 37 of 40 suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used

Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff -- twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast
F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
800 kg
 but is not needed for these numbers.


 but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin.

 so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months.



 so speculation unlikely.



 but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing.
 but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment.
But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
Dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
 but an S or particularly an X would be better

Looks like Model X resale value is holding up well :)

 not economic. Orbit requires extreme horizontal velocity. Getting to space needs none.
SolarCity panels produce enough zero carbon energy to charge entire Tesla fleet

Over 325k cars or ~$14B in preorders in first week. Only 5% ordered max of two suggesting low levels of speculation.

 coming this year





 but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity.


 but production AWD will be a lot faster


And of course it will have more cowbells.
Model 3 will be RWD with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain.













A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography so even tho total count is high ordering early will make a big difference locally.
In general product comments suggestions and criticisms are always welcome




 thanks!

 S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for 3. They deserve a lot of credit.
 but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines
 within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity.

Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe 20-30 people per store would line up not 800. Gifts on order.

Will give an update tonight for the 3 day total then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp.

 thanks for placing your faith in Tesla. I hope you have a great experience with the car.
Definitely going to need to rethink production planning
Thought it would slow way down today but Model 3 order count is now at 198k. Recommend ordering soon as the wait time is growing rapidly.
Model 3 orders at 180000 in 24 hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!





Thanks for tuning in to the Model 3 unveil Part 1! Part 2 is super next level but that's for later
 will cover whole country



Adding several more countries to Model 3 order page tonight. Check for details but will include India Brazil SA SK NZ Sing Ireland.
Model 3 orders whether in store or online are limited to two per person
Online ordering at  will now open at 7:30pm Pacific to ensure no server overload. Presentation still at 8:30.


Incredibly inspired by the interest in Model 3. You won't be disappointed. Also small token of appreciation coming for those who lined up.
Model 3 unveil will be webcast live at 8:30pm California time at

Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was 10 years away from achieving this. 
SpaceX Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing retail sales or service.
SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also most stressful but that goes with the territory.  

Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry) but next flight has a good chance.
Target altitude of 40600 km achieved. Thanks

There is no way it is only 0.5% given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every country or as high as 50%.

My best guess for 2016: ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go) then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017

Falcon lands on droneship but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs causing it 
 but payload would be greatly reduced.
 didn't get environmental approval in time but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed.
If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship no need to zero out lateral velocity so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h.
Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
As mentioned before ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed.

Well at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing. 

However that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok but a leg lockout didn't latch so it tipped over after landing.
Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area that's also translating rotating.
Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations.
Next launch is a 
Aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. Ship landings needed for high velocity missions

Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a 10% higher chance of a good landing. Punting 24 hrs.
Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
Meant to reply to this article:

 a Gigafactory in India would probably make sense in the long term.
 establishing charging and service infrastructure in Mexico now. Official launch in next several months.


These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability so no real news here.
Model 3 is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.

While the rocket does look rather tall tippy a stable landing is no problem with proper throttle response 
Cause of hard rocket landing confirmed as due to slower than expected throttle valve response. Next attempt in 2 months.

Right move is try both tunnels and flying cars. Otherwise having 2D streets and 3D buildings means bad traffic forever.
Reasons I like tunnels: you still travel in 3D fast but immune to weather quiet and no risk cars fall on your head
Flying car pros: travel in 3D fast. Cons: risk of car falling on head much greater noisy grounded in bad weather
Contrary to press reports I'm not against flying cars. Just said it was important to consider both pros and cons.

Thanks to everyone that supported Tesla in New Jersey! We couldn't have done it without you. 
However when self-driving cars become safer than human-driven cars the public may outlaw the latter. Hopefully not.
To be clear Tesla is strongly in favor of people being allowed to drive their cars and always will be. Hopefully that is obvious.
Battery pack swap is active between SF and LA and seems to be working well. Supercharging is the future though for non-commercial traffic.
Neither I nor the company are selling shares. Even if we were I wouldn't do this. It would be wrong. Our long term results are what matter.

Extreme wind shear over Cape Canaveral. Feels like a sledgehammer when supersonic in the vertical. Hoping it changes 
What Are The Civilian Applications? 
Prob good though. Will give us time to replace 1st stage video transmitter (not needed for launch but nice to have).
Air Force tracking radar went down. Launch postponed to same time tomorrow.
Rocket reentry will be much tougher this time around due to deep space mission. Almost 2X force and 4X heat. Plenty of hydraulic fluid tho.

Video made by owner of a P85D going up a 14% grade on snow passing a whole bunch of stuck SUVs 
Tesla dual motor cars are also all-wheel drive. Main goal of dual motor was actually insane traction on snow. Insane speed was a side effect
Tesla P85D 0 to 60mph acceleration will improve by ~0.1 sec soon via over-the-air software update to inverter algorithm
Great DragTimes video of people experiencing P85D Insane Mode acceleration for the first time 
Final one: anything launched by a railgun (if you could ever reach ~ Mach 27) would explode upon exiting the barrel in our dense atmosphere
Ion thrusters are great but have extremely tiny force (photon thruster even less). Must have more thrust than weight or you don't go up.
And pls don't ask me about space elevators until someone at least builds a carbon nanotube structure longer than a footbridge

The flight grid fins look like the ones on this test we did but larger: 


Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for x-wing style control. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll.
Base is 300 ft by 100 ft with wings that extend width to 170 ft. Will allow refuel rocket flyback in future.

Rocket engines are healthy but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch.

Yeah climate change should really be considered a centrist issue as it affects everyone.
Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production but rather to price in environmental cost shift to sustainable energy
Even if the answer is only on the order of 1% we should still take immediate action as there is only one atmosphere.
Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.

Technically I got rich from Zip2 PayPal w zero govt anything then put 100% of that into SpaceX Tesla SolarCity.
If consumption is low then the tax is proportionately low. We should prob not have tax on basic foods critical meds.
 we should not be exempt.
Net of gas savings a Tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. Maybe less costly then it first seems.
Yes am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution.
Trees are net consumers of CO2 so technically we would pay them money :)
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.

Me other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years got IPO+ govt money for 3 now paid back. Yes carbon tax would be a better way.
 just like we do a census.
Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase they just increase cost. Am against bans except in extreme cases.
Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide.
Perhaps. I am in favor of fair simple taxes that are neutral on most things incent good disincent bad.

First profitable Q for Tesla thanks to awesome customers hard work by a super dedicated team 
About to do chocolate egg hunt with all the kids. Candy bonanza! Happy Easter!
Thanks Bob ‚Äú
Sorry correct link is: 
If you support Tesla in Texas please contact your state Senate or House member. Free enterprise! 
Auto dealers in Texas are trying to stop Tesla. Would appreciate your help in fighting for what's right 
Rocket fairing almost ready for deployment test in vacuum chamber. Man lift on right for scale 
Can't make this stuff up: ‚Äú
A123 battery company renames itself B456 after bankruptcy (really).
Recovery ship has secured Dragon. Powering down all secondary systems. Cargo looks A ok.
Telemetry says main parachutes deployed now visually confirmed
Recovery ship just heard the sonic booms from Dragon reentry and has data transmission lock.
Dragon deorbit burn was good. All thrusters operating. On target for splashdown.
Future will indeed be rooftop solar + battery pack w utility company just providing backup power  
Slight change of date to ensure no end of quarter distractions -- will be Tues next week.
Really exciting 
There's crazy there's batsh*t crazy then there's North Korea crazy 



.
But when considering savings of gas v electricity true cost vs gas cars is more like $25k for a v sweet ride

. compelling electric car. We are 3 to 4 years away. Wish it could be sooner.

Orbit raising burn successful. Dragon back on track.
Thruster pods one through four are now operating nominally. Preparing to raise orbit. All systems green.
Pods 1 and 4 now online and thrusters engaged. Dragon transitioned from free drift to active control. Yes!!
Attempting bring up of thruster pods 2 and 4
Solar array deployment successful
Thruster pod 3 tank pressure trending positive. Preparing to deploy solar arrays.
About to pass over Australia ground station and command inhibit override

Genius move ‚Äú to be fair they did use the controversial gimmick of actually charging up the car‚Äù
CNN about halfway through East Coast Supercharger test drive of 
Testing the Model S on a surface of pure ice and snow 
Btw more free East Coast Superchargers coming soon. Will allow lower initial charge v high speed trip long detours like NYTimes drive.
 Top Gear pretended the Tesla Roadster ran out of charge and they had to push it home. Logs showed 50 miles range left.

Tesla data logging is only turned on with explicit written permission from customers but after Top Gear BS we always keep it on for media.
Tesla blog coming soon detailing what actually happened on Broder's NYTimes range test. Also lining up other journalists to do same drive.
NYTimes article about Tesla range in cold is fake. Vehicle logs tell true story that he didn't actually charge to max took a long detour.

My thoughts on the nature of the issue with the battery pack supplied to Boeing 
Desire to help Boeing is real am corresponding w 787 chief engineer. Junod's Esquire article had high fiction content.
Maybe already under control but Tesla SpaceX are happy to help with the 787 lithium ion batteries.
What it feels like to ride a rocket  
To be super clear I don't wish to (nor could I) mandate anything about a Mars Colony. Am just working on the tech to get people there.
Also I am not the kale eating overlord of Mars (altho kale has its moments) 
Nice story about a Model S coast to coast road trip. By end of year it will be Superchargers all the way! 
This gives a sense of what Mars would look like after changing the climate to sustain life 
Death Valley restored to position of world's hottest place

My big worry would be long (hopefully) term when I'm dead eg v sad situation with once great HP 
SpaceX will go public at some point as I think it should ultimately be owned primarily by the public 
 which is the art of creating useful things that didn't exist before.
Tesla articles 30 mins apart: This Stock is Screaming Buy  and This Stock Could Get DESTROYED 
Tesla was just approved for a full Class 1 Massachusetts Auto Sales License by a vote of 4 to 1. Much appreciated!

Interesting possible answer to the Fermi Paradox  
Am happy to report that Tesla was narrowly cash flow positive last week. Continued improvement expected through year end.
Uranium ore now available on Amazon! So much more convenient than Uzbekistan #AwesomeXmasGifts 

Can't put my finger on it but for some reason the newsstand is looking particularly good right now 
But if humanity wishes to become a multi-planet species then we must figure out how to move millions of people to Mars.
And yes I do in fact know that this sounds crazy. That is not lost on me. Nor I do think SpaceX will do this alone.
Millions of people needed for Mars colony so 80k+ would just be the number moving to Mars per year

Good assessment of the Dark Knight Rises in the Atlantic. Dickens not Rand. 

Goal for Model S is to show that electric is way way better than gas. Combine w solar power the future looks bright.
Worth noting that Muller's research confirming global warming is real was funded by Koch. Fate loves irony.
Olympics opening is excellently British. Jolly good show! 
Abandoned car and biked across London. Super fun! Next time minus the tweed jacket.

Major Tesla milestone: All crash testing is complete for 5* (max) safety rating. Cars can now be built for sale to public!
Just did an interview with Spaceflight Now. Some of your questions may be answered here: 
Simulations show launch ok with bad valve. Still better to stop fix. Recalling rockets after launch is not an option.
Launch aborted: slightly high combustion chamber pressure on engine 5. Will adjust limits for countdown in a few days.
Whatever happens today we could not have done it without but errors are ours alone and me most of all.
Must remember not to refer to Chimpanzees as deadly killing machines when taking little kids to see a movie about them

 not scalable. My grad student idea was to try to use advanced chip making equipment to create high energy density capacitors accurate to molecular level.

 as computer was so slow.
